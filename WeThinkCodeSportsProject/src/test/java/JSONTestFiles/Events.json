Construction began in November 2002 and in the months prior to its March 2004 completion, work was going on around the clock. Over 12,000 tonnes of stone were used in the build, a third of it Welsh granite, chosen for the track surface due to its excellent adhesive qualities.\r\n\r\nThe original 5.412 km Grand Prix circuit was designed with the spectator in mind, with 50,000 grandstand seats, all providing excellent views. Those spectators (a total of 100,000 over a race weekend) get to see the cars heading into the external desert area, before coming back into the oasis-styled infield. Up to 500 journalists can also witness the action from the venue's purpose-built media centre. \r\n\r\nA revised 'endurance' track layout was used for the 2010 event, with an additional complex starting at Turn Four extending the lap to 23 corners and 6.299 km, but the event has used the original track configuration ever since. It offers the driver a unique experience in the way the circuit's width varies at the end of the different straights. This allows for diverse racing lines, and the 15-corner design provides at least three genuine overtaking opportunities.",

The historic city centre, the beautiful seaside promenade and the impressive government house all combine to provide the perfect backdrop for the spectacular track.\r\n\r\n“Obviously street circuits present a number of challenges, in terms of circuit design, but we have been able to incorporate some unique features that will provide the teams and fans with fascinating racing,” he comments.\r\n\r\n“For example, the extremely narrow uphill section at the old town wall rewards pinpoint accuracy and courage, while the 2.2 kilometres along the promenade sees the cars running flat out at very high top speeds - an incredible spectacle for the race fans on track and the viewers at home.”",

The historic city centre, the beautiful seaside promenade and the impressive government house all combine to provide the perfect backdrop for the spectacular track.\r\n\r\n“Obviously street circuits present a number of challenges, in terms of circuit design, but we have been able to incorporate some unique features that will provide the teams and fans with fascinating racing,” he comments.\r\n\r\n“For example, the extremely narrow uphill section at the old town wall rewards pinpoint accuracy and courage, while the 2.2 kilometres along the promenade sees the cars running flat out at very high top speeds - an incredible spectacle for the race fans on track and the viewers at home.”",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Monaco Grand Prix is the one race of the year that every driver dreams of winning. Like the Indy 500 or Le Mans, it stands alone, almost distinct from the sport from which it was born. A combination of precision driving, technical excellence and sheer bravery is required to win in Monte Carlo, facets which highlight the differences between the great and the good in Formula 1.\r\n\r\nThe Armco barrier-lined circuit leaves no margin for error, demanding more concentration that any other Formula One track. Cars run with maximum downforce and brakes are worked hard. Overtaking is next to impossible so qualifying in Monaco is more critical than at any other Grand Prix.\r\n\r\nThe Portier corner is key to achieving a good lap time around Monaco. It is preceded by the Loews hairpin, the slowest corner in Formula 1, and followed by the tunnel, one of the few flat-out sections of the track. Some great names have ended their races in the barriers here, most notably Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. \r\n\r\nTo win in Monaco places a driver's name on a list that includes many of history's all-time greats.\r\n\r\nBoth Graham Hill, the man nicknamed 'Mr Monaco', and Schumacher won it five times, Alain Prost took four victories, whilst Stirling Moss and Jackie Stewart each won here three times. But the record of wins in the Principality resides with the Senna, who won in Monte Carlo six times. \r\n\r\nThe race has been a regular fixture of the world championship since 1955, but in that time the circuit has changed remarkably little. Slight alterations were made for the 2003 event, in particular a new, gentler entry to the Rascasse corner, with even bigger changes in 2004, with a new pit complex and increased spectator capacity.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Monaco Grand Prix is the one race of the year that every driver dreams of winning. Like the Indy 500 or Le Mans, it stands alone, almost distinct from the sport from which it was born. A combination of precision driving, technical excellence and sheer bravery is required to win in Monte Carlo, facets which highlight the differences between the great and the good in Formula 1.\r\n\r\nThe Armco barrier-lined circuit leaves no margin for error, demanding more concentration that any other Formula One track. Cars run with maximum downforce and brakes are worked hard. Overtaking is next to impossible so qualifying in Monaco is more critical than at any other Grand Prix.\r\n\r\nThe Portier corner is key to achieving a good lap time around Monaco. It is preceded by the Loews hairpin, the slowest corner in Formula 1, and followed by the tunnel, one of the few flat-out sections of the track. Some great names have ended their races in the barriers here, most notably Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. \r\n\r\nTo win in Monaco places a driver's name on a list that includes many of history's all-time greats.\r\n\r\nBoth Graham Hill, the man nicknamed 'Mr Monaco', and Schumacher won it five times, Alain Prost took four victories, whilst Stirling Moss and Jackie Stewart each won here three times. But the record of wins in the Principality resides with the Senna, who won in Monte Carlo six times. \r\n\r\nThe race has been a regular fixture of the world championship since 1955, but in that time the circuit has changed remarkably little. Slight alterations were made for the 2003 event, in particular a new, gentler entry to the Rascasse corner, with even bigger changes in 2004, with a new pit complex and increased spectator capacity.",

The race was the eighth round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship and marked the first time that the French Grand Prix has been run since 2008. It was the eighty-seventh running of the French Grand Prix, and the fifty-eighth time the event had been included as a round of the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the series in 1950.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton took an unchallenged victory in the French Grand Prix after his two closest rivals at the start collided at the first corner. His Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas was knocked into a spin by Sebastian Vettel in a chaotic opening lap at Paul Ricard. Both had to pit for repairs and Vettel later received a five-second time penalty for causing the collision.\r\nVettel recovered to finish fifth place, with enough of a margin in hand over Kevin Magnussen that his five-second time penalty didn’t cost him a position. Bottas closed on the Haas driver on the final lap but had to settle for seventh place.\r\nComing into the event, Felipe Massa was the reigning race winner, but he did not return to defend his win following his retirement from the sport at the end of the 2017 championship.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The 2018 French Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Pirelli Grand Prix de France 2018) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 24 June 2018 at the Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, France. The race was the eighth round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship and marked the first time that the French Grand Prix has been run since 2008. It was the eighty-seventh running of the French Grand Prix, and the fifty-eighth time the event had been included as a round of the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the series in 1950.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton took an unchallenged victory in the French Grand Prix after his two closest rivals at the start collided at the first corner.  His Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas was knocked into a spin by Sebastian Vettel in a chaotic opening lap at Paul Ricard. Both had to pit for repairs and Vettel later received a five-second time penalty for causing the collision.\r\nVettel recovered to finish fifth place, with enough of a margin in hand over Kevin Magnussen that his five-second time penalty didn’t cost him a position. Bottas closed on the Haas driver on the final lap but had to settle for seventh place.\r\nComing into the event, Felipe Massa was the reigning race winner, but he did not return to defend his win following his retirement from the sport at the end of the 2017 championship.",

The race was the tenth round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship. It marked the 73rd running of the British Grand Prix, the 69th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event, and the 54th time that the World Championship event had been held at the Silverstone Circuit. \r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton arrived at Silverstone one point adrift of Vettel in the drivers’ standings but confident in the knowledge that he was the favourite to win in front of his home crowd. That looked unlikely within moments of the start when Raikkonen locked up, sliding into Hamilton and pitching the five-time British Grand Prix winner into a spin. Hamilton kept the engine running, rejoined in last place and then set about one of his trademark comeback drives to limit the damage in the drivers’ championship.\r\nMercedes gave themselves a chance of snatching back the win by leaving Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas out when the Safety Car was called into action late in the race, while Ferrari and Red Bull pitted for fresh tyres. And for a few laps, it looked like it may work as Bottas held off Vettel, with Hamilton to third.\r\nBut ultimately, Vettel had too much pace on the softer tyres and after eyeing his prey for a few laps, brilliantly snatched the lead from Bottas. Hamilton also moved past the Finn, but he didn’t have the performance to attack Vettel and had to settle for second with Raikkonen third.\r\nIt was Vettel’s 51st victory, moving him level with four-time world champion Alain Prost in third in the all-time list. The German extends his championship lead over Hamilton to eight points heading to his home race at Hockenheim. It’s the first time it’s been more than a point ahead since the Chinese Grand Prix.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The 2018 British Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 2018 Rolex British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 8 July 2018 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. The race was the tenth round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship. It marked the 73rd running of the British Grand Prix, the 69th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event, and the 54th time that the World Championship event had been held at the Silverstone Circuit. \r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton arrived at Silverstone one point adrift of Vettel in the drivers’ standings but confident in the knowledge that he was the favourite to win in front of his home crowd. That looked unlikely within moments of the start when Raikkonen locked up, sliding into Hamilton and pitching the five-time British Grand Prix winner into a spin. Hamilton kept the engine running, rejoined in last place and then set about one of his trademark comeback drives to limit the damage in the drivers’ championship.\r\n   Mercedes gave themselves a chance of snatching back the win by leaving Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas out when the Safety Car was called into action late in the race, while Ferrari and Red Bull pitted for fresh tyres. And for a few laps, it looked like it may work as Bottas held off Vettel, with Hamilton to third.\r\n  But ultimately, Vettel had too much pace on the softer tyres and after eyeing his prey for a few laps, brilliantly snatched the lead from Bottas. Hamilton also moved past the Finn, but he didn’t have the performance to attack Vettel and had to settle for second with Raikkonen third.\r\n It was Vettel’s 51st victory, moving him level with four-time world champion Alain Prost in third in the all-time list. The German extends his championship lead over Hamilton to eight points heading to his home race at Hockenheim. It’s the first time it’s been more than a point ahead since the Chinese Grand Prix.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Hungarian Grand Prix is a motor race held annually in Hungary. Since 1986, the race has been a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship.\r\nThe first Hungarian Grand Prix was held on 21 June 1936 over a 3.1-mile (5.0 km) track laid out in Népliget, a park in Budapest. The Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and the Alfa Romeo-equipped Ferrari teams all sent three cars and the event drew a very large crowd. However, politics and the ensuing war meant the end of Grand Prix motor racing in the country for fifty years. \r\nAt the 2013 Hungarian Grand Prix, it was confirmed that Hungary would continue to host a Formula 1 race until 2021. The track was completely resurfaced for the first time in early 2016, and it was announced the Grand Prix's deal was extended for a further 5 years, until 2026.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton won a tense strategic battle at the Hungarian Grand Prix to head into Formula 1's summer break with a 24-point championship lead.\r\nFerrari appeared to blow their best chance to challenge the Mercedes driver, delaying a pit stop for Sebastian Vettel long enough to lose their advantage over Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas and emerge behind the Finn. It was a critical error that could have cost Vettel second place - but he fought back and passed Bottas with five laps to go.\r\nBottas misjudged an attempt to defend from Vettel, who passed on the outside on the run to Turn Two. Trying to keep the place from too far back, Bottas locked a wheel, slid onto the kerb, hit Vettel and damaged the Mercedes' front wing.\r\nVettel emerged unscathed and Bottas carried on, only to have another contact with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo when the Australian tried to pass around the outside at Turn One and Bottas locked up and slid into him. Bottas' troubles allowed Kimi Raikkonen to come through into third place behind his Ferrari team-mate, while Ricciardo passed him on the last lap to take fourth.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps circuit is among the most historic on the Formula One calendar, having hosted a (non-championship) Grand Prix as long ago as 1924, and remains one of the most popular venues with drivers and fans alike.\r\nRun on narrow public roads, the original Spa layout was an amazing 14.9 kilometres long and notoriously dangerous. The lap distance was reduced slightly over the years, with some corners eased, but when the 'old' circuit staged its final Grand Prix in 1970 it still measured just over 14 kilometres and remained staggeringly quick - Chris Amon set that year's fastest lap at an average speed of just under 245 km\/h.\r\n\r\nSpa did not return to the calendar until 1983 and then in drastically revised form, with lap distance cut to just under seven kilometres. Somehow, though, the circuit's magic was retained. Around two thirds of the lap used the original layout and the legendary Eau Rouge corner remained intact. Only the new Bus Stop chicane on the run down to La Source drew criticism.\r\nMore than twenty years on Spa remains the longest circuit on the calendar. Its mix of long straights and challenging fast corners, coupled with its picturesque setting, means that most drivers still rank it among their favourite tracks.\r\nThe weather is still notoriously changeable (it can often be simultaneously raining on one part of the track and dry on another) and Eau Rouge, with its high speed and sudden elevation change, maintains its reputation as one of Formula One racing's most technically demanding corners.\r\nSuch is the challenge of Spa that only the truly great drivers can really claim to have mastered it. In fact just six men have won the race more than twice - Juan Manuel Fangio (three times), Damon Hill (three times), Kimi Raikkonen (four times), Jim Clark (four times), Ayrton Senna (five times) and Michael Schumacher (six times).\r\n\r\nVettel decisively claimed the lead on what was a chaotic first lap of the Grand Prix, in which a late-braking Nico Hulkenberg triggered an enormous crash at Turn 1 involving Fernando Alonso and Charles Leclerc. Kimi Raikkonen and Daniel Ricciardo, meanwhile, also picked up what would ultimately prove race-ending damage in a separate incident.\r\nOnce in front, Vettel didn’t cede his advantage at any point, expertly managing the pace to claim his 52nd career victory and 107th podium – two stats that surpass the great Alain Prost’s records. More importantly, he stemmed the flow of his title rival’s momentum, taking seven points out of Hamilton’s championship lead to trail the Briton by just 17 points heading to Ferrari’s home race in Italy.\r\nHamilton was left to minimise the damage, driving a strong race to finish second – although he ultimately didn’t seem to have the pace to match the Ferrari around the power-sensitive 7.004km Spa track.\r\nMeanwhile Max Verstappen delighted the hordes of Dutch fans who’d crossed the border to watch their hero race by claiming a surprise third place – very much a welcome result, given Red Bull’s struggles for pace around the Spa track throughout the weekend.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Singapore Grand Prix is a motor race which forms part of the FIA Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia for F1 races. \r\nFirst organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the Orient Year Grand Prix. The following year, the race was renamed the Malaysian Grand Prix. After Singapore attained its independence in 1965, the race at the Thomson Road circuit was renamed to the Singapore Grand Prix. The event was discontinued after 1973 and a variety of reasons have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the very high danger and unsuitability of the track for racing, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and fatal accidents during the 1972 and 1973 races.\r\n\r\nThe 2018 Singapore Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 2018 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix) is a Formula One motor race scheduled to be held on 16 September 2018 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. The race will be the fifteenth round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship and will mark the nineteenth running of the Singapore Grand Prix and the eleventh time the race will be held at Marina Bay. \r\n\r\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton cruised to victory in the Singapore Grand Prix to strengthen his hold on this year's World Championship.\r\nHamilton's controlled drive from a pole position won brilliantly on Saturday was helped by the latest in a series of questionable strategy calls from Ferrari. It dropped Hamilton's title rival Sebastian Vettel from second to third behind Max Verstappen, throwing away a position the German had earned by overtaking the Red Bull driver on the first lap.\r\nHamilton's only worrying moment was caused by back markers at about two-thirds distance. Haas driver Romain Grosjean and Williams' Sergey Sirotkin ignored the closing Hamilton in the heat of their battle for position and cost him his five-second advantage over Verstappen.\r\nAt the front, there was a distinct lack of tension, as the drivers spent the vast majority of the race lapping seconds off their maximum potential to ensure they made the appropriate stint lengths.\r\nIt was a similar story to Monaco in May, when the hyper-soft tyre tyre was also used and teams were similarly trying to eke their tyres out to do a one-stop strategy.\r\nOnce he had fended off Verstappen's attack, Hamilton cruised to victory, the Dutchman held at arm's length, and Vettel cruising similarly behind.\r\nTheir team-mates Valtteri Bottas, Kimi Raikkonen and Daniel Ricciardo were playing a similar game of cat and mouse as they took the remaining positions in the top six.\r\nHamilton's victory, with Vettel third behind Verstappen, extended the Briton's advantage over the German in the championship to 40 points with six races and a maximum of 150 points remaining.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Russian Grand Prix  is an annual auto race held at Sochi Autodrom – a street circuit built around Olympic Park in Sochi, Russia, as part of the Formula One World Championship.\r\nThe race was first held briefly in the 1910s in Saint Petersburg of the Russian Empire. Plans were made to host a Formula One event in Moscow for the 1983 season as the Grand Prix of the Soviet Union, these plans fell through. In 2010, it was officially announced that the Russian city of Sochi, which was also preparing to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, would host a new event on the Formula One calendar, beginning in 2014 under a seven-year deal. \r\nThe inaugural event was held on 12 October 2014, and was won by British driver Lewis Hamilton, followed by German driver Nico Rosberg, both from the Mercedes-Benz team, and Valtteri Bottas, of Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2018 Russian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 2018 VTB Russian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 September 2018 at the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi, Russia. The race was the sixteenth round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship and marked the seventh running of the Russian Grand Prix and the fifth time the race was held in Sochi. \r\nThe race was moved from its April date to September to fill the vacancy of the Malaysian Grand Prix, which was discontinued at the end of the 2017 season. \r\n\r\nAt the start, Sebastian Vettel had a better start than Lewis Hamilton, but there was no room to overtake heading into turn one. On lap 4, both Scuderia Toro Rosso drivers Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley suffered brake failures which forced both to retire. They were the only retirements of the race.\r\nLater on lap 14, Hamilton made his one and only pitstop of the race, putting him behind Vettel. Two laps later, Hamilton made a move on Sebastian Vettel at turn 3 and passed him into fourth place into turn 4.\r\nThe most notable moment of the race came on lap 26, when Mercedes asked Valtteri Bottas to let Lewis Hamilton through into second at turn 13. Max Verstappen, who led the race since lap 19, came in for his pitstop on lap 42.\r\nHamilton won the race for the third time in his career, with Valtteri Bottas second and Sebastian Vettel completing the podium in third place. As a consequence, Hamilton extended his lead over Vettel in the championship to 50 points.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "One of the greatest tracks used in Formula One racing today, Japan's Suzuka circuit is a massive test of car and driver ability.\r\nBuilt by Honda as a test facility in 1962, the track was designed by Dutchman John Hugenholz, the Hermann Tilke of his day. A huge theme park was also constructed at the track, including the famous big wheel which dominates the Suzuka skyline.\r\nIn 1987, having hosted various sportscar and F2 races, and having lost out initially to Fuji in the race to host the Japanese Grand Prix, Honda's influence finally prevailed and the Grand Prix had a new Japanese home. And - 2007\/8 aside - at Suzuka the race has stayed ever since, providing the scene for many nail-biting end-of-season deciders, including the now infamous collisions involving Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. \r\nSuch moments only added to Suzuka's appeal with fans, with the Grand Prix now attracting some of the most passionate and knowledgeable crowds in F1 racing.\r\nThe track has also become a favourite with drivers, featuring some of the F1 calendar's most challenging corners. Among the most popular are the high-speed 130R and the famous Spoon Curve. On top of this the circuit's figure-of-eight layout makes it unique in F1 racing.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton moved to the brink of a fifth World Championship with a lights-to-flag Japanese Grand Prix victory. Mercedes' Hamilton was dominant as title rival Sebastian Vettel ran into trouble attempting to gain ground from eighth place on the grid.  Vettel spun to the back after colliding with Max Verstappen when trying a move for third place at the difficult Spoon Curve - but recovered to finish sixth.  The result means Ferrari's Vettel is 67 points behind Hamilton.\r\nThe Briton will secure the title at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, in two weeks' time if he wins the race and Vettel is lower than second, or if Hamilton scores eight more points than him.\r\nHamilton was in total control, but while Mercedes looked to be heading to an easy one-two after the pit stops, his team-mate Valtteri Bottas found himself under pressure from Red Bull's Verstappen.\r\nAfter a virtual safety car, called after Leclerc pulled off with a mechanical failure, Bottas began to run into blistering problems with his tyres.  Bottas dropped back from Hamilton and Verstappen was soon on the Finn's tail, and although he pressured him the end, the Red Bull driver could not get through.\r\nIt was an impressive drive from Verstappen, despite a five-second penalty served at his pit stop for rejoining the track dangerously in the incident with Raikkonen.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The United States Grand Prix is a motor race that has been held in the U.S. on and off since 1908, when it was known as the American Grand Prize. The race later became part of the Formula One World Championship. As of 2017, the race has been held 47 times, and it has taken place at 10 different locations in total. Since 2012, it has been held every year at the Circuit of the Americas.\r\nThe Grand Prix in Austin has proven to be a considerable success, thanks to the Texas capital's growing reputation as a center of music and culture, its friendly citizens and unique atmosphere during the race weekend. It has been lauded from all quarters of Formula One.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton just failed to clinch a fifth world title when he finished third in a thrilling US Grand Prix.\r\n Mercedes let a victory slip through their fingers by delaying a second pit stop and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen took his first victory for more than five years.\r\n  Hamilton's title rival and Raikkonen's team-mate Sebastian Vettel looked to have handed Hamilton the title early on when he spun battling with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.\r\n  Red Bull's Max Verstappen also beat Hamilton, who will have to wait until the race in Mexico next weekend to have another chance of clinching the title.\r\nHe leaves Austin, Texas, with a 70-point lead over Vettel, who eventually finished fourth, with 75 available over the remaining three grands prix.\r\n  In a tense finish, Raikkonen, Verstappen and Hamilton were nose to tail and the Mercedes driver failed in his one opportunity to pass the Dutchman with three laps to go.\r\nAs it happened, even doing that would not have been enough to clinch the title for Hamilton, as Vettel passed the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas for fourth place on the penultimate lap.\r\nAfter the race, Force India's Esteban Ocon and Haas driver Kevin Magnussen were disqualified from eighth and ninth places for fuel irregularities.\r\n  Ocon's car used more than the permitted maximum fuel flow of 100kg per hour on the first lap and Magnussen's more than the maximum fuel allowance of 105kg for the race.\r\n  The decisions moved Ocon's team-mate Sergio Perez into eighth place behind the Renaults of Nico Hulkenberg and Carlos Sainz, Toro Rosso's Brendon Hartley and Sauber's Marcus Ericsson into the final two points positions.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Mexican Grand Prix is an FIA-sanctioned auto race held at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City. It first appeared as a non-championship event in 1962 before being held as a championship event in 1963–1970 and 1986–1992. The Grand Prix returned in 2015 at the Mexico City circuit. \r\nThe Mexican Grand Prix was first held on 4 November 1962 at the Magdalena Mixhuca circuit. The circuit was the first international racetrack in Mexico and was built within a park in the center part of capital city of Mexico City. The race provided unique challenges for racing, standing at 2,240 (7,340 ft) above sea level, as well as the long, 180-degree, lightly banked and fast Peraltada corner that finishes the lap, in addition to being a bumpy racetrack from actively shifting soils beneath the circuit. The Mexican Grand Prix of this period was always the season finale Grand Prix, held in late October.\r\n\r\nThe trophy in Mexico City went to Max Verstappen, the Dutchman driving an exemplary race to repeat his 2017 victory at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. But while it was a fifth race win for Verstappen, it was a fifth title win for Lewis Hamilton, the British driver’s fourth place enough to see him crowned champion with two races to go, becoming only the third ever driver, behind Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher, to claim five world championships.\r\n  Sebastian Vettel knew that his chances of staying in the title hunt were minimal coming into the race. But despite putting in a fine performance – including executing a terrific move on Hamilton on lap 39 – to finish second, it wasn’t enough for Vettel to deny Hamilton.  The German inherited that second place after Ricciardo suffered his eighth DNF of the season, after his engine appeared to let go on lap 62. It was a cruel twist of fate for the Australian.\r\nVettel was joined on the podium by his team mate Kimi Raikkonen.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "The Brazilian Grand Prix  is a Formula One championship race which is currently held at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Interlagos neighborhood, Socorro district, São Paulo.\r\nMotor racing started in Brazil before World War II, with races on the 7.9-mile Gavea circuit in Rio de Janeiro starting in 1934. In 1936 construction began on Brazil's first permanent autodrome in the São Paulo neighborhood of Interlagos and was finished in 1940. Brazil held Grands Prix during the early parts of WWII at Interlagos and Gavea. Interlagos quickly gained a reputation as being a tough and demanding circuit with many challenging corners, elevation changes, a rough surface, and little room for error.\r\nFive Brazilian drivers have won the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Felipe Massa each winning twice, and Jose Carlos Pace winning once. The most wins ever is by the Frenchman Alain Prost, who has won the race 6 times (including 5 times at Jacarepaguá). Argentine driver Carlos Reutemann and Michael Schumacher have both won 4 times.\r\nOn 10 October 2013 it was announced that the contract for the Brazilian Grand Prix had been extended until 2022.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton took a lucky win in the Brazilian Grand Prix after Red Bull's Max Verstappen lost the lead in a collision with backmarker Esteban Ocon.Verstappen was on course for a superb win when Force India's Ocon left his car on the inside of the Red Bull at the Senna S and pitched it into a spin.\r\nThe incident dropped the Dutchman back to second place and although he came back at Hamilton, he could not quite catch him.\r\nFerrari's Kimi Raikkonen finished third, the red cars unable to challenge for the lead despite what had been perceived as an advantageous strategy. Ricciardo took fourth, ahead of Bottas, with Vettel, who also made a second stop, a struggling sixth.\r\nHamilton's win helped Mercedes secure the constructors' championship.",

The first race took place on 1 November 2009, held at the Hermann Tilke designed Yas Marina Circuit.\r\nThe inaugural race was Formula One's first ever day–night race, starting at 17:00 local time. Floodlights used to illuminate the circuit were switched on from the start of the event to ensure a seamless transition from daylight to darkness. Subsequent Abu Dhabi Grands Prix have also been day–night races. \r\nThe Yas Marina Circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke and is located on Yas Island – a 2,550 hectares island on the east coast of Abu Dhabi – and the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the first major event to take place on the circuit.\r\n\r\nLewis Hamilton won the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to end the season in which he won his fifth World Championship on a high. It was the 11th victory of the year for Hamilton, who dominated the race with a controlled drive.  Vettel took second after Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas faded to fifth, with Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo taking third and fourth.\r\nThe 2018 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the final race of an illustrious 17-year career in the sport for Fernando Alonso ,one that has yielded two titles – Alonso is the joint-fifth most successful driver to have entered a cockpit.",
